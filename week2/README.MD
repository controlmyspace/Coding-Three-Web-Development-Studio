<h1> Week 2 Task </h1>
Use hyperlinks in a creative/artistic context
Create a mini-website that uses hyperlinks in an artistic way. Think about how we can use hyperlinks as a tool for expression. For example:

- redirects in an infinite loop, write a poem using hyperlinks
- an archive for resources
- an interactive text-based / RPG game
- a non-linear novel or story
- a mini compendium of knowledge on a selected topic

feel free to explore more creative potentials of hyperlinks.
