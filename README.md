<h1> Weekly Tasks</h1>

<h2> WEEK 1 </h2>

Create an index.html file in your 'week_1' folder

Pick one topic:
intro about yourself,
styling & organising a poem, song lyrics, book fragment, etc.
Think about how you want to represent your personality or the selected text as a web page
use CSS text styling elements, incl. font-face, font, colours, etc.

Make a copy of the task from Hr 2. Make at least 1 new version of it and make the text easy to read according to the guidelines from resources below. Think about:
font size,
colours and contrast
line length
line spacing
semantic structure: include at least section, 2 header levels, paragraph tags.

Add an image to the page and ensure to add alt text.

In the documentation, include ~200 words on: 
screenshots of the different page versions
a description of what you did
a reflection on how the accessibility & readability of your page changed.

<h2> WEEK 2 </h2>
Use hyperlinks in a creative/artistic context
Create a mini-website that uses hyperlinks in an artistic way. Think about how we can use hyperlinks as a tool for expression. For example:

- redirects in an infinite loop, write a poem using hyperlinks
- an archive for resources
- an interactive text-based / RPG game
- a non-linear novel or story
- a mini compendium of knowledge on a selected topic

Feel free to explore more creative potentials of hyperlinks.

<h2> WEEK 3 </h2>
Using only HTML and CSS - draw a self-portrait
You are free to interpret this creatively

<h2> WEEK 4 </h2>

2. Optionally:

3. Main part:
Start designing the main page of your portfolio website using Figma. For this task, use a column system. The final version of your website does not need to be based on columns if you don't want it to be. The homework submission for this week needs to be based on columns.

For the final assessment, please include a public link to the Figma board.

<h2> WEEK 5 </h2>
Continue working on your website. Before next week, make sure you:
- have a basic design for your main page.
- know if the rest of the information will be separate pages or sections, and have these planned.
- have picked fonts, text sizes, and a main colour palette.
- You have at least 2 colour modes (light / dark). Optionally, there could be more, for example high-contrast.
- Your have designed the layout for at least 3 different screen widths, and ideally (refer to last weeks' resources).
- You have integrated up-to-date homeworks in the website prototype.

<h2> WEEK 6 </h2>
Website that changes with time
design a webpage that functions as a clock. Think about creative ways to represent time - through colors, shapes, typography, or abstract elements.

Optional prompts:

- What if your clock was a growing tree?
- What if time was represented through weather?
- What if the webpage was breathing?
- What if colors had a conversation throughout the day?
- What if time was a landscape that never repeats?
- What if fonts got more tired as the day went on?
- What if the page slowly filled with water?

Try to code your design. I appreciate some designs might be bold or advanced - if you know how to code it, that's great! If you don't think you can figure it out within a reasonable time, feel free to simplify it.

Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update your clock.

Further: Take it a step further - make a website that gradually changes over time. Consider how time itself can become a creative element in web design.

Technical hint: Look into the Date() function and setInterval
