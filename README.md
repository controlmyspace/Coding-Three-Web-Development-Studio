<h1> Weekly Tasks</h1>

<h2> WEEK 1 </h2>

Create an index.html file in your 'week_1' folder

Pick one topic:
intro about yourself,
styling & organising a poem, song lyrics, book fragment, etc.
Think about how you want to represent your personality or the selected text as a web page
use CSS text styling elements, incl. font-face, font, colours, etc.

Make a copy of the task from Hr 2. Make at least 1 new version of it and make the text easy to read according to the guidelines from resources below. Think about:
font size,
colours and contrast
line length
line spacing
semantic structure: include at least section, 2 header levels, paragraph tags.

Add an image to the page and ensure to add alt text.

In the documentation, include ~200 words on: 
screenshots of the different page versions
a description of what you did
a reflection on how the accessibility & readability of your page changed.

<h2> WEEK 2 </h2>
Use hyperlinks in a creative/artistic context
Create a mini-website that uses hyperlinks in an artistic way. Think about how we can use hyperlinks as a tool for expression. For example:

- redirects in an infinite loop, write a poem using hyperlinks
- an archive for resources
- an interactive text-based / RPG game
- a non-linear novel or story
- a mini compendium of knowledge on a selected topic

Feel free to explore more creative potentials of hyperlinks.

<h2> WEEK 3 </h2>
Using only HTML and CSS - draw a self-portrait
You are free to interpret this creatively

<h2> WEEK 4 </h2>
Watch and follow at least one of these tutorials on Grid systems in Figma.

2. Optionally:
3-hr Figma crash course which I found helpful (please note following it with pauses will take longer):

3. Main part:
Start designing the main page of your portfolio website using Figma. For this task, use a column system. The final version of your website does not need to be based on columns if you don't want it to be. The homework submission for this week needs to be based on columns.

For the final assessment, please include a public link to the Figma board.

<h2> WEEK 5 </h2>
Continue working on your website. Before next week, make sure you:
- have a basic design for your main page.
- know if the rest of the information will be separate pages or sections, and have these planned.
- have picked fonts, text sizes, and a main colour palette.
- You have at least 2 colour modes (light / dark). Optionally, there could be more, for example high-contrast.
- Your have designed the layout for at least 3 different screen widths, and ideally (refer to last weeks' resources).
- You have integrated up-to-date homeworks in the website prototype.

<h2> WEEK 6 </h2>
Website that changes with time
design a webpage that functions as a clock. Think about creative ways to represent time - through colors, shapes, typography, or abstract elements.

Optional prompts:

- What if your clock was a growing tree?
- What if time was represented through weather?
- What if the webpage was breathing?
- What if colors had a conversation throughout the day?
- What if time was a landscape that never repeats?
- What if fonts got more tired as the day went on?
- What if the page slowly filled with water?

Try to code your design. I appreciate some designs might be bold or advanced - if you know how to code it, that's great! If you don't think you can figure it out within a reasonable time, feel free to simplify it.

Use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and update your clock.

Further: Take it a step further - make a website that gradually changes over time. Consider how time itself can become a creative element in web design.

Technical hint: Look into the Date() function and setInterval

<h2> WEEK 7 </h2>
<h3>HTML Form Study</h3>

Use HTML form elements (inputs, buttons, sliders, etc.) to construct abstract, generative, or expressive visual compositions.

Experiment with the placement, size, color, and interaction of form elements to generate unique aesthetics.
Incorporate JavaScript to make your form-based designs interactive and responsive to user interaction, or have the interactions automatically happen with timing functions.
For example, have form elements trigger animations, transformations, or other dynamic effects.
Try unexpected placements, orientations, or combinations of form controls.


<h2> WEEK 8 </h2>
<h3>Life of a Personal Object</h3>

Using GSAP techniques from this week's class, create a scrollytelling website to design and build a story about on object 

<h4>Learning Objectives:</h4>
 - Demonstrate advanced technical skills by using GSAP and ScrollTrigger to create smooth, interactive scroll-based animations.
 - Apply GSAP techniques to design and animate a scrollytelling experience that communicates a cohesive narrative.
 - Build a functional and visually engaging website that effectively showcases the life and significance of a personal object.
- Develop a creative narrative about a personal object, considering its origins, transformations, and emotional journey.
 - Utilize animations to represent key moments and changes in the object's history, emphasizing its sentimental or symbolic value.
 - Integrate interactive elements, such as hover effects or clickable features, to enhance user engagement and storytelling.
 - Explore and experiment with advanced animation techniques, such as timelines and staggered effects, to add depth to the project.
 - Ensure the website design aligns with user experience principles, balancing interactivity with accessibility and readability.
 - Reflect critically on the object's representation and its ability to convey personal or cultural significance to an audience.

1. What is the object?
What personal object holds significant meaning to you?
Is it something passed down through generations?
Is it an item with a unique story, like a gift or a meaningful purchase?
Does the object have sentimental value, or does it represent a specific event or memory?
2. Think About Its Origins
Where did the object come from?
Was it bought, found, or given to you?
Does it have a history that predates your ownership (e.g., family heirlooms, vintage items)?
How did it come into your life, and why was it important then?
3. How Has the Object Changed Over Time?
Does the object have physical changes (wear and tear, repairs, modifications)?
Has it evolved in function, use, or significance?
Are there moments when its appearance or role in your life shifted?
4. Key Moments in the Object’s Life
What are the key moments in the object’s "life"?
Was it involved in any significant events or memories (e.g., a trip, an important moment)?
Did it serve as a reminder, or provide comfort or inspiration during tough times?
5. The Object’s Significance in Your Life
What role does this object play in your life now?
Does it still serve the same purpose as when you first got it?
How do you interact with it today?
Does it still hold the same emotional weight, or has it changed in significance over time?
6. What Story Does the Object Tell?
How does this object represent who you are or your experiences?
Does it symbolize something larger, like a phase of your life or a specific interest or hobby?
What would people learn about you if they only saw this object?
7. Animate the Journey of the Object
How can you visually represent the object’s journey?
Could you use animation to show the object changing, moving through different environments, or interacting with other objects or people?
How will you convey its emotional journey (e.g., nostalgia, sentiment, evolution)?
8. What’s the Impact of the Object on Others?
Has this object ever been seen by others or shared with anyone?
How do others perceive it (is it just an object, or does it hold personal significance for others)?
Has it affected your relationships, or sparked meaningful conversations?
9. What is the Future of the Object?
What do you think will happen to the object in the future?
Will it continue to be passed down or evolve?
Will its meaning change as time goes on?
Does it hold any potential to influence or inspire others in the future?
10. How Can You Make It Interactive?
Can you create a timeline or animated journey of the object’s life?
How will you use ScrollTrigger to make the object come to life as users scroll through its history?
Can you include interactive elements (e.g., clicking or hovering to reveal hidden details or new stories about the object)?
